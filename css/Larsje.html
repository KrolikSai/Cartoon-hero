    <h2>ABOUT LARS</h2>
    <p1>Once upon a time a booger was born. He was named after the Great Lavrentiy of Amsterdam. From the young age, he was curious about the world around him. One particular hobby of his was football. It has been proven by scientists that he came into this world in a football jersey. True story.      </p>
    <p2>Another passion of Lavrentiy is food. Treats, in particular. Anything from fruit to potato chips will make him drool. However, carrot cake made by Liesje is always preferred.</p2>
    <p3>When one wishes to see Lavrentiy, he can always be spotted sitting at his desk studying or thinking about Liesje.</p3>
